Please read this before trying to build any terrains

In this file, I address the format used to generate geometric terrain in the game's world
Please notice only positive coordinates are allowed due to Box2D limitations.

Your .map file must contain
- the number of polygons listed
- for each polygon:
	- the number of vertexes
	- the coordinates (positive), in both axis
	
And that's it. As simple as it can get. In a better notation, one would expect something as follows:

< number of polygons >
< polygon 1 number of vertexes >
< vertex 1 x coordinate > < vertex 1 y coordinate >
< vertex 2 y coordinate > < vertex 2 y coordinate >
...
< vertex n x coordinate > < vertex n y coordinate >
<polygon 2 number of vertexes>
< vertex 1 x coordinate > < vertex 1 y coordinate >
< vertex 2 y coordinate > < vertex 2 y coordinate >
...
< vertex n x coordinate > < vertex n y coordinate >
...
<polygon n number of vertexes>
< vertex 1 x coordinate > < vertex 1 y coordinate >
< vertex 2 y coordinate > < vertex 2 y coordinate >
...
< vertex n x coordinate > < vertex n y coordinate >

Example files are in this folder, so you can use them as guidelines.
