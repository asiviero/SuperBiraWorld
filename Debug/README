Physics Simulator

This is a very basic physics simulator. I'm using OpenGL and C++ to simulate simple physical phenomena, such
as gravity, bouncing, friction (on surfaces and, futurely, on air) and collision with punctual bodies.

Any help is deeply appreciated, as this is only academical interest, although it could be adapted as an engine
for gaming and other kinds of simulation.

I'm trying to keep the code as organised and structured as possible and, thus far, it has a clear division between
drawing (mostly handled by OpenGL) and the physics itself (mostly contained as the code for the main Agent).

Drawing is very simple and any basic experience in OpenGL is certain to be enough to understand what I'm doing here.
I myself don't have neither much knowledge or experience with graphics, so I'm keeping it as simple as possible.

The main Agent code is where the magic happens. It's a class, whose properties deal with the agent's characteristics
and movement vectors. Its methods deal mostly with the movement. There're 4 main vectors: floatAgentPosition, floatAgentSpeed,
floatAgentAcceleration and floatAgentForce, who, as it may look like, control the agent's position, speed, acceleration and the
resulting force acting on it. All the math is included in this class methods.
